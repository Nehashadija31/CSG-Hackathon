        <p class="game-name">Two Truths and a Lie</p>
        <p><strong>"Two Truths and a Lie"</strong> is a fun icebreaker game where players take turns sharing three statements about themselves: two truths and one lie.</p>
        <p><strong>Setup:</strong> Choose a video conferencing platform such as Zoom, Skype, or Google Meet. Invite players to join the virtual meeting room.</p>
        <p><strong>Gameplay:</strong> Establish a turn order for sharing statements. Each player takes their turn to share three statements about themselves: two truths and one lie. Players can use video and audio features to present their statements. Other players guess which statement is the lie, either by raising their hand or using the chat function. The player reveals the lie after all guesses are made. Repeat the process for each player until everyone has had a turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Winning:</strong> While there's no strict winner, players can keep track of correct guesses for fun. The focus is on fostering interaction, building connections, and having a good time with fellow players.</p>
